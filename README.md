#### Application designed to determine vacation destination, 02/24/2017

#### By Steven Galvin

## Description

This is an application designed to show you one of three vacation destination results based off of your answers to five questions I picked out. It uses Javascript, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap to style and function. It gathers your information and uses your first name to respond to you personally to add a touch of personality to the page. Here is a link to my github pages https://steven-galvin.github.io/vacation-quiz/
